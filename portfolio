Hi, I’m Chinwenmeri Amalaha and i'm just getting started with data.
I’m interested in data, it's analysis, [Amalaha Chinwenmeri RESUME.docx (1).pdf](https://github.com/chynwe-bekee/chynwe-bekee/files/8312023/Amalaha.Chinwenmeri.RESUME.docx.1.pdf)
it's visualization with the neccessary data analytics tools (such as Excel, SQL, Python Etc), The fact that i get to study a raw data and be able to analyse it really interests me as this takes lots of discipline and no cutting corners, also i'm interested in customer service, accounting, finance and risk management.
I’m currently learning data analytics as we never stop learning , also with an open mind to learn any other thing that will make my data work progress.
I’m looking to collaborate on data analyst roles, be it intern or any other that will help me grow.
